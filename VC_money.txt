Funds are raised from a # of sources- HNIs (High Net worth individuals), pension funds (kept by employee | employers), insurance companies, endowments (money kept aside/invested to earn revenue, the beneficiary of an endowment fund is a nonprofit organization instead of individual investors.), etc; 
who know that only 0.05% of all startups are successful. It’s an educated gamble with a disproportionately high level of risk, and an even higher level of reward.

VCs are made up of LPs (money), GPs (money + fund mgmt) and then the ops staff (investment team, legal team, finance team, etc).

There’s a likelihood of groupthink creeping in in such scenarios, which a lot of folks refer to as FOMO investing.
VC s are supposed to spot businesses which would be loved by customers and earn a lot of money. Which means they need to think from the perspective of the customer. It’s anyday easier for an Ivy League educated, ex-IB, Delhi/Bombay person to evaluate whether 10 min grocery delivery will be a hit or not, rather than whether a tractor pooling service for farmers in Bihar will be successful.

$𝟮𝟰.𝟭𝗕 was invested in Indian startups in 2021, and keep in mind most of it is foreign wealth. To put this in perspective, our govt’s cap exp in the same year was $74B.
Everyone is posting the “8000 employees laid off” bit, but why do we forget the same ecosystem also created ~𝟮𝗟 𝗷𝗼𝗯𝘀 𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿 alone? And then figure in the indirect employment- the sutta tapri/ juice & snacks shop below the coworking space, the rickshaw folks ferrying people from metro stations, the housekeeping staff employed in offices, security personnel, etc.
Another aspect which I can’t quantify but really value- spirit of entrepreneurship. From school kids to our parents- everyone is inspired to think differently and “startup ". That means a lot in a country where life beyond IIT & AIIMS was a doomed path just a couple years ago.

Teething problems will always exist. Give a chance to this ecosystem to mature and create wonderful value for all Indians.
